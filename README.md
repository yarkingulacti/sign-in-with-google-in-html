# About the repo

This repo demonstrates how you can use google sign in in a browser(HTML file). Originally this Oauth process was called Google Sign-In, but since it's deprecated([see more](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/quick-migration-guide)) I've done migration and included a basic express server for verifying authentication.

## What to do after downloading this repo?

Duplicate `env.example.js` and name it `env.js`, then fill the data. After that start your server and you're good to go!
